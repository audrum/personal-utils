# Cursor Move

This small script moves the cursor 1 pixel every 60 seconds just to keep your operating system awake and "online" status in your corporate messaging app.

## How to use

First install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once it is installed, install [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) with the command:

```Python
pip3 install pyautogui
```
You can change the time that you want to stop editing [line 8](https://github.com/audrum/personal-utils/blob/f01de5577f0f953f8f7c4eebf4e7f4a276057511/cursor_move.py#L8)

Then execute the script with the command:

```
python3 cursor_move.py
```

For manual stopping just press Ctrl + C
