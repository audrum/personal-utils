# Cursor Move

This small script moves the cursor 1 pixel every 60 seconds just to keep your operating system awake and "online" status in your corporate messaging app.

## How to use

First install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then install [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) with the command:

```Python
pip3 install pyautogui
```

Then execute the script with the command:

```
python3 cursor_move.py
```
